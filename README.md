## Background
Since the Aquarius doesn't do much on it's own, and playing games on the chicklet keyboard is annoying, adding the functionality of the Mini Expander is essential. The Mini Expander expands the sounds to three voices, adds both a RAM and cartridge expansion slot, and has ports for the Aquarius control pads. But since many Aquarius users DON'T have easy access to these devices, particularly in Europe, I felt it was essential that this PCB be made available.

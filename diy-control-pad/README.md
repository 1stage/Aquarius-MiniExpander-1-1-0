## Purpose
While reverse engineering the Mini Expander, it became obvious very quickly that there was also a need for easy-to-make Control Pads for the Aquarius. Those, as many of my UK/EU friends have said, are rare as hen's teeth. The stock unit was designed to be SUPER cheap and SUPER easy to crank out in quantity, however, the processes used in making the conductive ink, flexible control boards for the joysticks are not easily recreatable by a casual maker or electronics enthusiast. So I designed these "fugly" control boards using inexpensive, easy to source through-hole tactile switches and LN4148 diodes, a PCB, and a commonly available Atari/Sega joystick extension cable.
